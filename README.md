Check out aq_dashboard2.py for the code.
Right now it's connecting to an api, selecting two columns of data, adding that data to the database. I'm trying to figure out what 
I need to put in my __repr__ in order to print out queries from my database nicely.

go to parent directory and then
on windows set FLASK_APP=aq_dashboard2.py
on linux or mac FLASK_APP=aq_dashboard2.py

url/refresh will refresh and add to the database.
